    - As a user, I should be able to type a task into the input field.
    - As a user, I should be able to click some form of a submit button.
    - As a user, the task string that I provided should appear on the DOM after the submit button has been activated.


NOTE    Info needed
        What do I need to do?
        How do I do it?

STEP 1
    - Use DOMContentLoaded or put defer in the script tag to ensure JavaScript will NOT run until after HTML page fully loads

STEP 2 
    (Identify all elements/nodes needed)
    - Store form in a variable (let form)
    - Store tasks list in a variable (let tasks)

STEP 3
    - Create addEventListener for submit on the form
    - Use e.preventDefault() to stop it from automatically handling submit so I can use JavaScript to handle submit

STEP 4
    - Store user's input *value* in a variable (let userInputTask)

STEP 5  Creates li tag, fills it with user input, then appends to list 
        (ALTERNATE Solution Below after the BONUS)    
    - Use createElement to create li tag (used to add each new task to the tasks list)
    - Store the li tag in a variable (let liTask)

STEP 6
    - Use innerText to fill li tag (liTask) with user's input (userInputTask)

STEP 7
    - Use appendChild to append li tag (liTask) to the DOM's ul tasks list(tasks)

    NOTE    Open Dev tools to use debugger; in the JavaScript file
            Check variables (in Sources in lower console)
            NOTE To circumvent the console's autofill, use space/back arrow/return

    NOTE    innerText refers to text only
            innerHTML refers to tags & text

STEP 8
    - Used .reset() on the form to clear the user's input box after each task entry
    ex. taskForm.reset()

    NOTE    GOOGLE: JavaScript clear form input after submit
            Clear user's input box without using reset()
            https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-clear-form-after-submit-in-javascript-without-using-reset/

    NOTE    innerText (tag) â‰  value (input)

BONUS
    Added if statement with alert & return to prevent blank entries to the task list
  
  ======================================

ALTERNATE Solution

STEPs 5 - 7 REPLACEMENT: Adds to tasks.innerHTML instead of creating an li tag
    - Use     tasks.innerHTML += `<li> ${userInputTask} </li>`
    NOTE Simply use backtick string interpolation to add onto the tasks list which is already part of the HTML DOM and has already been stored in the JS tasks variable

STEP 8 (Same as above)

STEP 9 Make the task delete button actionable
    NOTE OUTSIDE OF SUBMIT event listener because the ul tag (with id="tasks" already stored in tasks variable) is the parent so knows about the li tag children

    - Use addEventListener on tasks (the parent) to access and delete child li tasks information

    NOTE STEP 9: Use the JS specific data- attribute (in the taskForm event listener) on the tasks/li/button tag instead of id because all added tasks should NOT have the same id
        ex  data-anyname = "delete"
    This will select the data for the specific delete button clicked

    - Use e.target.dataset.anyname to set up if statement to get the delete action
        NOTE Use the debugger in the tasks listener to test it by clicking a delete button

    - Use e.target.parentElement.remove() to go up one level from child to parent in orger to delete the correct li tag parent of the targeted delete button
